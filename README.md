A tiny project I've made as a recruitment task and to make some reusable components (infinite scroll list, search bar with suggestions etc.). It uses TypeScript and React with styled-components. I've even made tests! Some of the components used in the projects used a lot of work to work properly (especially the infinite scroll list and search bar). This is a tiny project where I've focused on quality of code instead of sheer volume.
