The task was completed fully. I've considered using Redux in it but I've decided to settle with useContext as I think it's less of an overkill for a given task. 
The app allows the user to search for a user by his username, view all his repositories (sorted by the amount of stars) and view the languages used in a dropdown menu. 
The app was tested, although not thoroughly because of the time limit. The errors were handled, although throughout the development process the only error 
I've noticed that's possible for the user to encounter is the 403 code error which basically means that the API limit was reached (and since the api documentation is not very useful in this regard I've decided to ditch the idea of handling all the possible errors). 
It turned out to be a very annoying error also during development process and required me to stop working periodically just to allow my usage limit recover.
